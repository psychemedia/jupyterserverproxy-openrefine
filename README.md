# jupyterserverproxy-openrefine
Jupyter-server-proxy config for running OpenRefine

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psychemedia/jupyterserverproxy-openrefine/start)

This `start` branch demonstrates:

- using a `binder/start` file to auto start OpenRefine;
-  a notebook/client demo; this essentially runs in a headless mode, though you will need to ensure that a project exists before you try to open one! (There are no projects provided as a default in this example.)
